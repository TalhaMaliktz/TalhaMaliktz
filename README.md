### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Technical Writer with a master's in Information Security. I have been producing original, articulate, and engaging content for my clients for more than 8 years. My skills include:


- API Documentation
- Software Requirement Specifications
- Diagrams (All kinds of UML diagrams)
- Deployment Guides
- User Manuals/Guides
- Release Notes
- UX Copywriting
- Agile Themes, Epics, User stories
- E-books
- Tutorials (How-tos)
- Database Design Documents
- Test Cases
- White Papers
- Articles.
- Technical Reports (Security, Research, Software, etc.)

Being a researcher myself, I am accustomed to producing content in Latex, Markdown, and other Word processors. I am also skilled in working with the docs as a code philosophy. I have produced various eBooks and technical documents for my clients and their testimonials describe my sheer commitment to my work and to my clients. I also have a few publications to my name, so I know the importance of non-plagiarized, error-free, and concise content. I strongly believe that "the devil lies in the details". So, rest assured I will move heaven and earth to provide you with the quality you expect and pay for.

I pride myself on providing the highest quality of work, and for me, a project is unfinished until the client is satisfied. If this is what you want, then get in touch with me.
