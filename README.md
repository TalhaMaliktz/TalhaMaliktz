# Hi, I'm Talha! 👋

> **Senior Developer Advocate & API Engineer**
> *Specializing in Developer Support, Ecosystem Migration, and "Zero-to-One" Engineering.*

I describe myself as a **Technical Enabler** - an engineer who sits at the intersection of Core Product and Ecosystem Growth. My background spans strict **Enterprise Engineering (C#/.NET)** and **Modern Decentralized Architectures**, allowing me to bridge the gap between legacy infrastructure and modern tooling.

I don't just "support" developers; I architect the systems that allow them to build, scale, and remain secure.

### 🚀 What I Do
* **Ecosystem Architecture:** Managing "Technical Source of Truth" during high-stakes migrations (e.g., L1 to L2 migration strategies).
* **"Customer Zero" Engineering:** Maintaining scaffolders, validating SDKs, and building the "Golden Path" reference implementations.
* **Incubation & Activation:** Designing technical curriculums for Hackathons and Incubators to stress-test developer tooling in the wild.
* **Technical Support Lead:** Owning escalation flows, debugging integration friction, and implementing AI-driven support automation.
* **Docs-as-Code:** Treating documentation as a product using Docusaurus, Markdown, and automated CI/CD workflows.

### 🛠 Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Node.js, TypeScript, C# (.NET), Solidity (Foundry/Hardhat).
* **Architecture:** REST/GraphQL API Design, EVM Architecture, Optimistic Rollups.
* **Frontend:** React.js, Docusaurus, MVC Architecture.
* **Backend & Data:** SQL, Windows Server/IIS, SDK Integration Strategy.

### 🎤 Global Workshops & Advocacy
I travel globally to deliver **Technical Workshops**, not just keynote fluff. My goal is to take developers from *listening* to *deploying* in under an hour.
* **Key Topics:** Zero-to-One dApp Deployment, Migrating Web2 APIs to Web3, Security Best Practices.
* **Field Work:** Technical Mentor for startups at **CV Labs**, **AyaHQ**, **SUCI x Lisk Hub** and **Lisk Spark** incubators.
